# LeetCode Java Solutions

Hi there,  

I created this repository to **document my learning journey** — solving problems one step at a time.  

I’m still learning, and sometimes it’s hard.  
But I’m trying my best, and every solution here is a small victory in my journey of understanding programming logic and problem-solving.  

Each solution will have **comments explaining the flow and thought process**, so that anyone who sees it can understand not just the code, but also the **logic behind it**.  
At this stage, I’m **not worrying about time or space complexity** — my goal is to get comfortable with coding and problem-solving.

**A little reminder to myself (and anyone reading this):**  
> Learning is not a race. Every line of code you write teaches you something new.  
> Keep trying, keep learning, and don’t give up.
